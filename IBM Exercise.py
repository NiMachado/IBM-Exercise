# # IBM Exercise

# Introduction: This is an exercise for the course: IBM - Tools for Data Science.

# Many languages can be use for data science but the main languages are Python and R.

# the main data science libraries in Python are:
# - Pandas (data structure & tools)
# - NumPy (arrays and matrices)
# - Matplotlib (plots & graphs)
# - Seaborn (heatmaps, time series)
# 
# High-level machine learning and deep learning libraries in Python:
# - Scikit-Learn (tools for regression, classification and clustering)
# - Keras (deep learning neural networks)
# - TensorFlow (DL) - Low-level framework used in large-scale production of deep learning models. (Production and deployment)
# - PYTorch (experiments, deep learning regression and classification)
# 
# The main data science libraries in R are:
# - dplyr - Data manipulation
# - stringr - String manipulation
# - ggplot - Data visualization
# - caret - Machine learning

# DATA SCIENCE TOOLS
# Data management - Sources (collecting and retrieving data)
# Data integration and transformation - ETL
# Data visualization - Transforming the values to graphical representation
# Model building - Train data and analyze patterns
# Model deployment - Integrating a model into a production environment
# Model monitoring and assessment - Tools that monitore models
# 
# Code asset management - Developers use versioning to track and manage changes to a software project code (GitHub)
# 
# Development Environments - IDEs 
#

# OPEN SOURCE TOOLS FOR DATA SCIENCE PART 2
# DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT
# 
# - Jupyter Notebooks (most used)
# - Jupyter Lab
# - Apache Zeppelin
# - R Studio
# - Spyder (mimics R)
# 
# Sometimes your data doesnâ€™t fit in a single computer or memory, so you use:
#     Apache Spark - Batch processing engine - Cluster environment and linear scalability
#     Apache Flink -Stream processing image - Real time streams
#     Riselab Ray - Large scale deep learning model training
# 
# FULLY INTEGRATED and VISUAL TOOLS
